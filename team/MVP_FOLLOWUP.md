MVP Follow-Up


Feedback Grouped and Sorted
1. Lack of Understanding / Explanation (Important: 15+ mentions)
Users don't understand what "deepfake protection" means or how the masking works. They want clear explanations of what happens to their images and why it protects against deepfakes.
2. Need for Before/After Comparison (Important: 8+ mentions)
Users want to see visual proof of changes - side-by-side comparison of original vs. protected images before downloading.
3. Testing & Verification (Important: 9+ mentions)
Users want proof that protection actually works against deepfake algorithms. 
4. About/Demo Section (Important: mentions)
Users want an About page or demo section explaining the project's purpose, how to use it, and why it's important.
5. Expand File Type Support (Important: 12+ mentions)
Support beyond JPEG needed: PNG, WebP, GIF, and especially videos.
6. Multiple Image Upload (Medium: 5+ mentions)
Allow batch processing instead of one image at a time.
7. Customizable Protection Levels (Medium: 5+ mentions)
Let users choose protection strength vs. quality tradeoff (low/medium/high settings).
8. UI/UX Improvements (Medium: 5 negative, 15+ positive)
While most liked the simplicity, some found it plain/dark/spam-like. Suggestions include better colors, iconography, and mobile responsiveness.
9. User Accounts / History (Medium: 5+ mentions)
Optional feature for saving/accessing previously protected images.
10. Browser Extensions & Integrations (Medium: 6+ mentions)
Auto-protect images before social media uploads, mobile app support.
