Project: Deepfake Protection

Mentor: Self-Mentored

Meeting Time: lab02

Type of meeting: sprint planning and daily scrum <one or several of [sprint planning, daily scrum, sprint review, retrospective, story time]>

Team:Rohil Jain [x], Milad Haghighi [x], John Vu [x], Anit Annadi [x], Srish Nigam [], Sharanya Gehlot [], Arman Sajjadian [x], Henry Bartz [x]

Scribed Discussion:
Our intention for future scrums is to keep them to around 10-15 minutes, ideally held at the end of each lecture or lab. We will focus on sharing what happened and then later work on how to fix it or adapt if needed.
We received a great explanation and talk-through from Gen about how the deepfake protection algorithm actually works and the potential issues we might need to keep in mind (the backend is difficult to keep running efficiently fast, hosting is difficult because there will be a lot of users and a heavy process).

Project pivot:
After understanding what is actually done by the algorithms (poisoning future data sets) and that current deepfake algorithms cannot actually be stopped by this method, we are considering a pivot. We will likely pivot toward protection for artwork via GLAZE and LPIPS as opposed to marketting the product as a protection method for Instagram posts from current deepfake algorithms.
