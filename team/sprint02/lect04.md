Project: Deepfake Protection

Mentor: Self-Mentored

Meeting Time: lab02

Type of meeting: sprint planning and daily scrum <one or several of [sprint planning, daily scrum, sprint review, retrospective, story time]>

Attendance: Rohil Jain [x], Milad Haghighi [x], John Vu [x], Anit Annadi [x], Srish Nigam [], Sharanya Gehlot [x], Arman Sajjadian [x], Henry Bartz [x]

Scribed Discussion:
We discussed new libraries which we had found and shared over the weekend. Since these libraries have established results which they even have posted on their website, we can rely on them more heavily as opposed to researching a complete algorithm.

Project pivot:
Final decided pivot is that we are moving to artwork protection.

Task work: 
Arman: Continued library research and will be implementing a protection masking method with noise to see its efficacy.

Anit: Learning.md work

John: Fixing node modules and license.md

Milad: Leadership.md work

Rohil: scribed scrum notes, will develop basic frontend functionality so that there is a place to test (built in React)

Henry: Retro leader for the week, try to use a noise library to see if it works for backend

Sharanya: Implement button to select and sort files from computer (limited to only JPEG up to 5 mb)

Srish: -not present- Assigned: library work (implement a noise method and see its efficacy)
