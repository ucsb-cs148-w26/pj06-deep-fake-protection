The problem is that users want to post images to the internet without worrying about malicious actors taking their image and using them to generate deepfakes on them. 

While users want to protect their likeness they still want to be able to post their photos without censoring them. Ideally photos wouldn't be visibly changed but still protected. 

For example, take Peter Jones who is a 22 year old social media influencer that frequently posts photos online and is concerned about deepfakes.

User Needs:
- Prevent misuse of his photos for deepfakes
- Protect privacy without visible image chnages
- Use a tool that is simple and fast
