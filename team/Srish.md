Hi, I'm Srish and I am a second year student majoring in Computer Science. I am most familiar with python and React as well as C++ from the computer science classes here. I believe we can use react and python to build this project as we can use python libraries such as tensorflow and scikit learn. For this project, I think we can try to change the minimimal amount of pixels in an image to find the maximimum amount of discrepency for an AI generated image. One idea I have for this is to use SVD math as that gives us the least and most important pieces of an image.
