My name is Anit and I am a 2nd year Computer Science major. I have experience across the stack esepcially in JavaScript, TypeScript, Go, Postgres, and MongoDB.

It would be cool to develop this project using a python based stack. This would include using FAST api for the backend and SvelteKit for the frontend. Also, I think it would be useful to use Pytorch or another machine learning library like TensoFlow to do research with. Another use of these libraries would be to manipulate the image to give it "deep fake protection."

Ideas I have to give an image deep fake protection are similar to that of my groups. This includes:

- changing pixels that mess up machine learning models but are not visible to the human eye
- adding a water mark
