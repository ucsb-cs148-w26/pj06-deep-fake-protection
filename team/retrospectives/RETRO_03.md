- Led by: Milad
- Present: Arman, Rohil, Sharanya, Anit, Milad, John, Srish, Henry

# Start/Stop/Continue

Continue\
Rohil: continue holding each other accountable on task deadlines\
Sharanya: continue pair programming sessions as they helped with the desktop app\
Srish: continue writing thorough documentation alongside feature development\
Henry: continue testing across different platforms to catch bugs early\

Start: \
Arman: setting up automated testing pipelines for the desktop builds\
Anit: scheduling dedicated code review sessions so PRs don't sit too long\
John: creating user guides for the desktop app features as we ship them\
Milad: writing more unit tests for the core deepfake detection logic\

Stop:\
Srish: merging without at least one approval from another team member\
Sharanya: leaving branches open for too long without rebasing\
Arman: waiting until the last minute to update the Kanban board\

## Action item

- Goal: Improve our release workflow now that we have a working desktop application
- Experiment: Create a checklist for each release that includes building, testing on all platforms, and updating documentation before marking a task as done
- Measure: We will expect fewer post-merge bugs and quicker turnaround on releases compared to the previous sprint

## Optional

- Record anything else you think the team might want to remember from this retro: We successfully shipped the desktop version of the deepfake protection app this sprint which was a huge milestone for the team.

## Experiment/Change

- Our experiment was to use the Kanban board more actively and ensure no tasks sat unassigned or stale
- Results: Task throughput improved and we had better visibility into blockers, which helped us finish the desktop app on time
- A decision going forward: we will continue using the Kanban board actively and add platform-specific labels now that we support a desktop build

## Retro Assessment

- We used the Start/Stop/Continue format where each team member contributed ideas for things to start doing, stop doing, and continue doing.
- The retro went well as the team reflected on the progress made with the desktop app and identified areas to tighten up our release process.
- Advice for the next retro leader: Keep energy high by celebrating wins first before diving into improvements, and make sure quieter members get a chance to share.
