# Start/Stop/Continue

Continue\
Rohil: continue mentioning when we need someone to merged in our groupchat\
Sharanya: communicating when you won't be here\
Srish: giving progress texts to let everyone know where we are\

Start: \
Arman: requiring two approvals for merges\
Anit: star putting comments on the code at least one per function\
Henry: Utilize the Kanban and assign tasks to yourself, include better tasks descriptions\
John: Start allocating time outside of class to work on the project\

Stop:\
Srish: Please stop merging your own commits before approval \
Milad: Stop being late to class \
Arman: Stop being disengaged during the lecture\

## Action item

- Goal: Utilize Kanban more for efficiency and greater clarity
- Experiment: make a greater effort to assign ourselves things and approve merges
- Measure: We will expect that there will be no duplicate issue or issues that have become stall (sitting for a long time) without anyone assigned.

## Optional

- Record anything else you think the team might want to remember from this retro: "the friends we made along the way" - Milad
