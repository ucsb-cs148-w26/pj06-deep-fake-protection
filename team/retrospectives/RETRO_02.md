## Action item

- Goal: Utilize Kanban more for efficiency and greater clarity
- Experiment: 
- Measure: We will expect that there will be no duplicate issue or issues that have become stall (sitting for a long time) without anyone assigned.

## Optional

- Record anything else you think the team might want to remember from this retro: "the friends we made along the way" - Milad

## Experiment/Change

* Our experiment was to make a greater effort to assign ourselves things and approve merges
* Results: We had greater visibility and understanding of who owned what taks and people took more ownership
* A decision going forward: we will keep the change as we observed positive results
