## Action item

- Goal: Utilize Kanban more for efficiency and greater clarity
- Experiment:
- Measure: We will expect that there will be no duplicate issue or issues that have become stall (sitting for a long time) without anyone assigned.

## Optional

- Record anything else you think the team might want to remember from this retro: "the friends we made along the way" - Milad

## Experiment/Change

- Our experiment was to make a greater effort to assign ourselves things and approve merges
- Results: We had greater visibility and understanding of who owned what taks and people took more ownership
- A decision going forward: we will keep the change as we observed positive results

## Retro Assessment

- We used the Start/Stop/Continue format where each team member contributed ideas for things to start doing, stop doing, and continue doing.
- The retro went well as we had good participation and identified actionable items around Kanban usage and task ownership.
- Advice for the next retro leader: Make sure everyone has a chance to speak and keep the discussion focused on actionable improvements.
