## About Me
My name is Sharanya Gehlot and I am a third year computer science major.

## Project Ideas
This app empowers artists and privacy-conscious users to safeguard their digital identity. By utilizing advanced adversarial perturbation techniques, the software adds a "cloaking" layer to images that is 
invisible to the human eye but fundamentally confuses AI models. This prevents neural networks from accurately scraping, learning from, or recreating the image, effectively "breaking" the training process for 
that specific file without compromising its visual quality for human viewers.
