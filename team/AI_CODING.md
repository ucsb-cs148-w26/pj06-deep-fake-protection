AI Tool: Perplexity AI \
Outcome/Reflection: I received a list of options for scaling our product and reasoning behind why each option is a good idea. Some of the ideas were helpful, but a lot of them were somewhat basic or not very well-thought out. For example, it suggested we completely change our project flow so that the user sees an in-progress screen as opposed to a simple upload process. While this is not a bad idea, it is a lot of work for a very minimal change. To ensure good output, I had to be explicit with descriptions of the project and what it does so that it had minimal room for interpretation. I accidentally forgot to include that no image storage occurs and it gave a lot of details on that which I didn’t want, so I had to adjust that.


Henry \
AI Tool: ChatGPT \
Outcome/Reflection: I think that this tool was very helpful. I had no prior experience with React, and ChatGPT helped me understand its ins and outs. I first tried to understand what was going on by watching YouTube videos, but ChatGPT answered my questions much more quickly and directly. 


Milad \
AI Tool: Gemini \
Outcome/Reflection: This tool helped me figure out the basics of React since previously I was not super familiar with the syntax and usage. It definitely helped in speeding up the learning process since it was able to give me examples I could build off of and give me advice on how to write the code properly.


Sharanya \
AI Tool: Claude AI \
Outcome/Reflection: I used Claude to create a mockup of a potential about page for our website. The output was an About.jsx file, and was useful to save time and create a comprehensive multi-section page with a good layout. To ensure correctness, we would need to manually go through the content that was produced and ensure it is accurate. 


Arman\
AI Tool: Gemini\
Outcome/Reflection: I used Gemini to help me analyze why our deployment was crashing/running out of memory. It identified that the libraries we were using were very large and that we could refactor our algorithm to not use these large libraries. I had it refactor the code and the output was a python file with the refactored algorithm without the bloated algorithms.  


Anit \
AI Tool: DeepSeek \
Outcome/Reflection: I used DeepSeek to research and compare different algorithms for deepfake detection and protection. We are already using an algorithm in our code but I used DeepSeek to see if there were better algorithms. DeepSeek helped summarize the trade-offs between different algorithms. It specifically talked about accuracy, performance, and implementation. This helped narrow down which algorithm we are going to use for the final project. I did make sure to cross-check details that it outputted to ensure they were correct.


Srish \
AI Tool: Cursor
Outcome/Reflection: I used Cursor to help set up the information pipeline between our React frontend and Python FastAPI backend. The output was working API endpoint code and corresponding fetch requests on the frontend to handle image uploads and return processed results. Cursor was particularly helpful in explaining how to properly structure FastAPI routes and handle file uploads with proper CORS configuration. The AI-assisted approach saved significant time compared to just reading documentation, though I still needed to debug issues with FormData formatting and response handling on my own. 


John \
AI Tool: Gemini \
Outcome/Reflection: I used Gemini to help define the technical architecture for our MVP, specifically deciding on a React frontend with a Python FastAPI backend. It also helped me articulate the core logic of our deepfake protection tool, using adversarial perturbation and Gaussian noise to disrupt AI generation. This clarity was crucial for setting up our project roadmap and ensuring the team was aligned on the technical approach.
