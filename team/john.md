### Project Vision: Deep Fake Protection
My goal for this project is to build a defense mechanism against unauthorized AI video generation. As synthetic media becomes more sophisticated, I want to create a tool that empowers individuals to protect their digital likeness.

**My ideas for the project include:**
* **Adversarial Perturbation:** Implementing a program that uses matrix mathematics and Gaussian noise to strategically "scramble" or shift specific pixels.
* **Targeted Protection:** Finding the minimal amount of change required to break AI video generation models while keeping the image looking natural to the human eye.
* **Accessible Interface:** Developing a simple, intuitive web application where users can upload their photos and receive a "protected" version of the image instantly.
