1. If something happens and you can't show up or do your work on time, communicate with the group, preferably in the text group chat first.

2. If you are absent text your scrum updates to the group and continue to get your work done.

3. If you are absent, if possible, call in with the team just to be present and try to do the scrum update in that manor.

4. In the scenario where someone is not doing the work, we will mediate for a week, and then if the scenario does not improve we will forward the issue to the instructor.

5. If there are differences in ideas we will hold a team vote to decide how to move forward, if the vote is even we will flip a coin.

6. If you are reviewing a PR and it doesn't seem up to team standards, discuss it as a team to decide how to move forward.

7. Try to keep all important discussions in team group chats for future reference and to allow all team members to keep up with current goals.

8. All pull requests should two approvals before merging, each person should merge their own PRs.
