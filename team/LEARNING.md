# Assessment of Skills

Anit: Experience with JavaScript, TypeScript, Go, Python, C++, and SQL
Arman: React, Pytorch, Python
Rohil: React, HTML/CSS, svelte, java, c++
Sharanya: React, HTML/CSS, JavaScript
Henry: C++, Python
John: Python
Milad: C++, Python, C#
Srish: JavaScirpt, Python, FAST API

# Assessment to Develop Knowledge

The team has a lot of knowledge regarding frontend and backend API development. Our main gap is in using PyTorch and the torchattacks library beyond basic scripts. The team also needs experience deploying and debugging our stack on Vercel.

# Specific Commitments

- Anit, Henry, and Milad commits to working through a PyTorch tutorial focused on model inference during week 3, and a tutorial on the torchattacks library during week 4
- Arman commits to reviewing FastAPI documentation and building a small test API during week 3, and integrating it with a Python ML script during week 4
- Rohil commits to completing a React tutorial during week 3, and building a simple frontend that fetches data from a FastAPI endpoint during week 4
- Srish commits to exploring FASTApi + ML integration in week 3, and testing Vercel deployment of the backend in week 4
- John commits to doing a React tutorial during week 3, and a tutorial on PyTorch in week 4
- Sharanya and Rohil will pair during the initial React + FastAPI integration, with both working together in-person to help each other out
- John and Milad will pair on PyTorch model testing, with John writing test scripts and Milad reviewing them in week 3, then both working on deploying the model via FastAPI in week 4

# List of Important Technolgies by Stack

- PyTorch for loading models, running inference, and evaluating results
- torchattacks library for generating adversarial examples
- FastAPI for exposing Python ML functionality as backend endpoints
- React for building and managing the frontend user interface
- Vercel for deployment of frontend and backend
