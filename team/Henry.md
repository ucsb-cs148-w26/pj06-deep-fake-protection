# Henry Bartz
My name is Henry and I am a third year CS major.  

## Experience
I have experience with C++ and Python. I have also dabbled with OpenCV and other Python computer vision libraries before.

## Ideas
I think it would be awesome to get this project to the point where it could be incorporated with social media apps so that users could protect themselves from deepfakes before uploading their images online.
