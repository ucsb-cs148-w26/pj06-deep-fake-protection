User Roles:
We have a single user role: anyone who wants to post images online and protect them from malicious actors who may create deepfakes.

How does your app allow them to accomplish their goal?
Our app will include a masking feature that alters the user's image in a way that is undetectable to the human eye, but throws off a deepfake algorithm.
